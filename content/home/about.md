# Background

I am a Data Scientist & Professional Educator at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com). We develop free and open source tools to make it easier and more fun to do data science with the statistical programming language [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org). We also create software to help teams who use R to share and publish their work.

I studied psychology and quantitative methods, receiving my Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University (2008). For eight years, I was a professor and scientist at Oregon Health & Science University, where my research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific journal articles and book chapters on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. 

I have developed and delivered workshops, graduate-level courses, and curricula based on teaching R, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and [literate programming](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). You can follow my current work for [RStudio Education on GitHub <i class="fab fa-github-alt"></i>](https://github.com/rstudio-education).
