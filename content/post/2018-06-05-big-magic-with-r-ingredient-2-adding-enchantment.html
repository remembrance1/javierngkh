<p>Last week, I presented a keynote at the <a href="https://cascadiarconf.com/agenda/">Cascadia 2018 R Conference</a> called “Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear”. In it, I talked about learning R- whether you are a beginner and just started to learn R, or whether you are an advanced user and need to learn new things in R every day. If you want to see the slides, they are <a href="http://bit.ly/cascadiarconf18-magic">here</a>.</p>
<p>For my talk, I was inspired by the book <a href="https://www.elizabethgilbert.com">“Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear”</a> by Elizabeth Gilbert. In it, Elizabeth argues that there are five essential ingredients needed to live creatively, and they are:</p>

<p>In my talk, I argued that these same five essential ingredients are needed to creatively learn R, and I talked about why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level. So, practical big magic. In this series of blog posts, I wanted to present each of these five ingredients and provide some more context beyond the slides.</p>

<h1>Courage</h1>
<p>What does courage have to do with learning R or learning new things in R?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have the courage to do what you need to do before you are FORCED to do it.” – <a href="https://www.elizabethgilbert.com/thought-of-the-day-have-the-courage-to-do-what-you-need-to-do-before-you-are-f/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a></p>

<p>My own personal anecdote is that I had been learning R for about a year, when my colleague threw a new challenge at me that I <em>could</em> have solved using R. We were working together on a book chapter on epidemiology and autism, and he is constantly touring the world presenting on this topic. Based on conversations with other researchers, he created <a href="https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides.html#6">some visualizations</a> to highlight specific issues he noticed were hard to talk about without a picture. The message seemed to be more impactful with a graphic, rather than when he tried to just talk about it in words. The slides he shared with me were data visualizations, but involved hypothetical data to demonstrate important concepts (concepts for which “real” data don’t exist- that is actually one point of these visualizations). At the time, I had a feeling that I <em>could</em> have solved this problem using <code>ggplot2</code>, but we only had a week to submit the draft of our book chapter to the publisher. I ended up making a new graphic that was a <a href="https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides.html#18">total abomination</a>- I continue to be <a href="https://github.com/apreshill/ohsu-biodatavis/commit/7a0e1b80248b30d1b5fc62ecf6c0cb2d839ecbdb">horrified</a> by it and remain concerned that the dataviz powers that be will revoke my <a href="https://apreshill.github.io/data-vis-labs-2018/">dataviz teaching license</a>.</p>
<p>What is the lesson here? I knew I needed to learn <code>ggplot2</code> long before this challenge was presented to me, and I wish I had had the courage to learn it myself. Why didn’t I learn it before? Because reasons. I’m sure there were some. I honestly don’t know what they were now, but I do know I thought I would get to it at some point, and it just didn’t happen.</p>
<p>After this experience, I vowed that I would not let my lack of technical knowledge force me to submit knowingly sub-par work again. So I learned <code>ggplot2</code>. I learned to love <code>ggplot2</code>. And I circled back to that damn plot and made it so much <a href="https://apreshill.github.io/ohsu-biodatavis/slides.html#51">better</a> that I am actually proud to <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/talk/ohsu-biodatavis/">talk</a> about it now.</p>
<p>This is why courage is important: it is taking the first step to being kind to yourself as a new learner. It is acknowledging that you are human, and that you have a life outside of <em>learning this new thing</em> (a job, kids, hobbies, friends, family, etc). Courage is a big word, but it doesn’t have to be. To me, courage is a plan. This is practical courage. Making a plan for your own learning respects all of you, not just work you.</p>

<h1>Forms of Courage</h1>
<div id="collective-courage" class="section level2">
<h2>Collective courage</h2>
<p>Throughout most of your child, adolescent, and adult learning experiences, it is likely that a lot of the courage gathering was done for you. A great example of this is the classic syllabus. A good one will lay out the necessary elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should you be able to do at the end that you don’t already know how to do? (learning objectives)</li>
<li>How much time should you expect to spend on learning in/out of class? (time commitment)</li>
<li>What topics will you learn, and in what order? (scoping + sequencing)</li>
<li>What materials are needed outside of attending class? How much do they cost? (textbook, online materials, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="independent-courage" class="section level2">
<h2>Independent courage</h2>
<p>If you are a self-directed learner, you’ll need to gather your own courage. You can’t just declare that you are going to learn R, or learn to do deep learning in R without figuring out where to start. I recommend thinking about the same things as should go into a good course syllabus:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new thing do you want to learn?</li>
<li>How much time do you need?</li>
<li>What comes first, second, third, etc?</li>
<li>What resources will you use? How much do they cost?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Changing Plans</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can measure your worth by your dedication to your path, not by your successes or failures.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let your plan evolve. That is a sign that you are learning. Think of it like a dynamic document. Figure out that you missed a key package you needed to learn? Add it! Decide that you wrongly eschewed the tidyverse? It’s not too late! Realize that in order to learn <code>purrr</code> you need to understand lists? Make a plan to fill in that knowledge gap!</p>
</div>
<div id="courage-is-contagious" class="section level1">
<h1>Courage is Contagious</h1>
<p>Remember: &gt; “Our fear is contagious, but our courage also is. And our courage makes other people be able to be more brave, and come out of their houses, and come out of their shells, and out of their fear.” ― <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/elizabeth-gilbert-choosing-curiosity-over-fear/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a></p>
<div id="on-fear" class="section level2">
<h2>On Fear</h2>
<p>I know the word “fear” was in the title of my talk, but I didn’t talk about it. Largely because it is sort of irrelevant. I do sometimes have learners tell me they are scared to learn or try R. I think that is fine. It’s also fine if you aren’t scared. Either way, I offer this advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your fear must be kept in its place. (True emergencies only, please.) Your fear must not be allowed to make decisions about creativity, passion, inspiration, dreams. Your fear doesn’t understand these things, and so it makes the most boring possible decisions about them.” – <a href="https://www.elizabethgilbert.com/your-fear-is-boring-i-can-say-this-with-all-honesty-and-authority-because-i-k/">Elizabeth Gilbert</a></p>

<p>So, onward :)</p>
