# Who, what, when, where, why, and how

A few ~~days~~ ~~weeks~~ months ago, I sat down with [Chester Ismay](http://chester.rbind.io) to make a package. I had been sitting for months already on a really fun bunch of datasets I scraped from Wikipedia on "The Great British Bake Off" for my [new DataCamp.com course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-data-in-the-tidyverse). For years, I have been **so jealous** of all these awesome people who make awesome R data packages. Then Chester, co-author of the [{fivethirtyeight}](https://fivethirtyeight-R.netlify.com) and [{infer}](https://infer.netlify.com) and [{moderndive}](https://moderndive.com) packages, *offered* to help me make my data into a data package, and then things got really exciting.

We sat down for a few hours and [DID IT](https://bakeoff.netlify.com)! And I did what I always do- took serious notes in an R Markdown doc and took lots of screenshots as breadcrumbs for myself, also thinking that maybe a future blog post might be a good way to bundle up all of Chester's data-package-making magic. But then things happened, my laptop went in for major surgery, and I put writing the blog post off. THEN, I saw this tweet:

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1029438219689938944")
```

And THEN the lovely [Irene Steves](https://irene.rbind.io) linked to a [package tutorial presentation](https://isteves.github.io/r-pkg-intro/Presentation.html#/) she did awhile ago using `devtools` instead of `usethis`, and offered to collaborate on the post too! 

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1029460619068497921")
```

Now this little project of ours got both exciting but real.

Chester, Irene, and I had a video conference this past week, went over a draft of this post, and now the pressure is on. without further ado (and I promise, with fewer gifs), we present our code-through of making a package using `usethis`! And our first spoiler: you will need other packages too.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1hMk06C3GSozNLO4vX/giphy.gif)

# Use this now

What is [`usethis`](http://usethis.r-lib.org)?

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1027293165735358464")
```

[`usethis`](http://usethis.r-lib.org) is a new-ish package by the folks at RStudio to automate workflow management. There are all kinds of workflow-related functions for non-package projects as well, alongside a comprehensive suite of functions specific to [package development](http://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#section-package-development) which we'll refer to in this post. However, as with most package reference docs, they assume you know a proper package development workflow already. So this post will attempt to give you a play-by-play for when to use which `usethis` function, and why. 

Disclaimer: there are many package development workflows- this is just one offering.

Do this first:

```{r}
# Install and load the package
install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)
```


-Made the package
-Dependencies
-Edit description
- add license
- add vignette
- add news
- add readme

_Note: the next release of `devtools` will automatically install `usethis` for you and load it whenever you run `library(devtools)` (see the [conscious uncoupling](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools#conscious-uncoupling) of the devtools package  for more details)._

# Create the package

The first step is to create and name your new package. You can do this several ways. If you are working in RStudio, you can do File -> New Project -> R Package. You could also use `usethis::create_package`, which if not already within an R Project, will create a new R Project for you.

But, we are guessing you'll eventually want to use GitHub here (for lots of reasons), so I first set up a new GitHub repository without a README. At this point, you'll want to consider your package name. Names must not have any special characters and can only contain letters, numbers, and dots. You are probably better off using all lower-case, like `gapminder`, `fivethirtyeight`, etc. We went with `bakeoff`. 

Once I had my `bakeoff` GitHub repo, I opened up RStudio and ran:

```{r}
# Clone the remote repo
create_from_github("apreshill/bakeoff") # owner/reponame
```

This creates an R Project for you that is linked to your remote GitHub repository. Alternatively, you can try the `use_git()` and `use_github` workflow as [Tomas Westlake does in his blogpost](https://r-mageddon.netlify.com/post/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/). If you run into problems, [Jenny Bryan's Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html) or this [RStudio Community thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/difficulty-using-usethis-use-github/5579/7) have helpful tips for troubleshooting SSH issues. 

With the project open, we were finally ready to actually create the new package:

```{r}
# Create a new package -------------------------------------------------
create_package(here::here()) # could have also used getwd() or "."
```

What did this step do? (edit this below)

* `R/`: the R code

* `man/`: the documentation (generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand)

* `DESCRIPTION`: the metadata of the package

* `NAMESPACE`: how the package interacts with R and with other packages (do not edit by hand)


# Add dependencies

I wanted to have the ability to include vignettes with details about how this data was scraped and wrangled, a la Jenny Bryan's `gapminder` package. So we needed to add dependencies. Chester told me **NOT** to add the `library(tidyverse)` as a dependency, or Mara might come after me. So we listed all these `tidyverse` out with `type = "Suggests"` since they are not necessary for actually *using* the data package. We tried this first, which did not work:

```{r}
# this won't work
use_package(c("rvest", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "stringr", 
              "janitor", "purrr", "lubridate", "ggplot2"), 
            type = "Suggests")
```

And produced this error:

```{r}
Error in use_package(c("rvest", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "stringr",  : 
  could not find function "use_package"
```

So we decided to try using `purrr::walk` to apply the `use_package` function to each element in the new `deps` vector we made.

```{r}
# this will work
deps <- c("rvest", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "stringr", 
          "janitor", "purrr", "lubridate", "ggplot2")
library(purrr)
walk(deps, usethis::use_package, type = "Suggests")
```

And success! That worked.

# Update the description

after updating description with persons and SAVING


note: very important! In authors there is a blank in the vector `, ,`. If you delete this you'll get a crazy error later on:
```{r}
devtools::document()
It is recommended to use ‘given’ instead of ‘middle’.
Invalid DESCRIPTION:
Authors@R field gives no person with maintainer role, valid email address and
non-empty name.
```

I should have left the space in, or specified `email = ` for the third argument, becuase the function `person` assumed this was my middle name.

We also updated the version number. What on earth do those numbers mean?

I also noticed that Nick Tierney links to his ORCID, and went hunting around in his GitHub to see how. You can specify this in the DESCRIPTION:

```
Authors@R: c(
  person("Alison", "Hill", 
          email = "apresstats@gmail.com", 
          role = c("aut", "cre"),
          comment = c(ORCID = "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8082-1890")),
  person("Chester", "Ismay", email = "chester.ismay@gmail.com", role = "aut"))
```



# Add a license


```{r}
use_mit_license("Alison Hill")
use_vignette("bakeoffs-abroad")
```

```
✔ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'MIT + file LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE.md'
✔ Adding '^LICENSE\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE'
```

# Make news.md + readme.rmd

```{r}
use_news_md()
use_readme_rmd()
```

in read me
```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("apreshill/bakeoff")
```

# Write package-level docs

```{r}
use_package_doc()
```

This creates a new file in the `R` folder called `bakeoff-package.R`. This script is actually just the help page for the whole package, so what you see if you type `?bakeoff` after loading the package.

I edited `bakeoff-package.R` using https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/R/fivethirtyeight.R


# Write more docs

Link to some examples on GitHub package site.

* `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Opt/Alt` + `Shift` + `R` inserts roxygen skeleton

```{r}
use_r()
```

# Create package data

Since we are making a data package here, now is a good time to add data. But, because all this work went mainly into the scripts for scraping and wrangling "The Great British Bake Off" data, I wanted to save those too. 

> "`use_data()` makes it easy to save package data in the correct format. I recommend you save scripts that generate package data in data-raw: use `use_data_raw()` to set it up."

```{r}
use_data_raw()
```

The eventual package data needs to be `*.rda` files, but it is not so simple as just copying/pasting a `.rda` file and plopping it in the `data/` folder. There are actually three distinct steps:

1. Use `use_data_raw()` and add .R scripts to that folder for scraping the Wikipedia data. Naming conventions are critical here- all my scraping scripts are titled "thing-scrape.R". These scripts didn't have any input data, but I did want to save the intermediate (read: pre-wrangled) .csv files, so they each ended with this kind of line:

```{r}
write_csv(bakers_df, here::here("data-raw", "bakers.csv"))
```

2. Next came the wrangling scripts, also within the `data-raw/` folder, which were each named "thing-wrangle.R". Each of these scripts begin with a line like this:

```{r}
bakers <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data-raw", "bakers.csv"))
```

3. At the end of each wrangling script is the critical export line, going back to the `usethis` package. This line exports the final data frame as a `*.rda` file and places it now in the `data/` folder:

```{r}
usethis::use_data(bakers, overwrite = TRUE)
```


# Use `roxygen` (move this to earlier after description)

Why? Two main things that should be roxygenized: 

- Vignettes
- Documentation

So far, everything in your `R/` folder is inert. It needs to be roxygenized: `roxygen` will look for `*.R` files in your `R/` folder, and will automatically convert them into `*.Rd` files in your `man/` folder.

this updated the description file
```{r}
use_roxygen_md()
```

```{r}
✔ Setting Roxygen field in DESCRIPTION to 'list(markdown = TRUE)'
✔ Setting RoxygenNote field in DESCRIPTION to '6.0.1'
● Re-document
```

TWO MAIN THINGS
-vignettes
-setting up documentation (everything in the `R/` folder is where `roxygen` will look for stuff to put automatically in `man/` folder as `*.Rd* files)

may need: https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/blob/master/data_import_procedure.md


Now `man` is empty though! Need to get stuff from `R` file into `man` using `roxygen`. There's good stuff about roxygen in the [R packages cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/devtools-cheatsheet.pdf) and within RStudio (Help --> Roxygen Quick Reference).

Two ways- see screen shots

# Build the package

OK, now we are switching to the `devtools` package. 

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```


We are going to build this thing. Our goal is to be able to type `?bakeoff` and see if we get the help page. To build, the keyboard shortcut you need here is: `COMMAND + SHIFT + B`. We did this and then held our breath...

![](/post/2018-06-29-data-package_files/first-build.png)

And we got a successful build!

Then, in the console, I was able to load our little `bakeoff` package:

```{r}
library(bakeoff)
Warning message:
package ‘purrr’ was built under R version 3.4.4 
```

And the real test:

```{r}
?bakeoff
```

# Make a package website

Sometimes the things that seem the hardest at the outset are actually the most painless. Case in point: making a website for your shiny new package. It is actually easy (I really try to avoid using that word!) with the `pkgdown` package. 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6vY2Ef4cKfRf8loc/giphy.gif)


I didn't have `pkgdown` installed at first, which was OK still to run this function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_pkgdown()
● Modify '_pkgdown.yml'
✔ Adding '^_pkgdown\\.yml$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Creating 'docs/'
✔ Adding '^docs$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```

(can edit `_pkgdown.yml`): https://github.com/andrewpbray/infer/blob/develop/_pkgdown.yml

Now you can build your site with `pkgdown`, although at this point (obviously) that package does need to be installed and loaded.

```{r}
install.packages("pkgdown")
library(pkgdown)
```

Then you use:

```{r}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This function creates a static site in your `docs` folder. You can also use the RStudio Addin "Build pkgdown". 

# Edit your package site

You can edit the newly created `_pkgdown.yml` file to customize your site. For example, you can insert links for the individual authors, and you can also use Bootswatch themes:

```
url: https://bakeoff.netlify.com

authors:
  Alison Hill:
    href: https://alison.rbind.io
  Chester Ismay:
    href: https://chester.rbind.io

template:
  params:
    bootswatch: flatly
```

Chester did a bunch more custom formatting because I managed to really screw up the rendering here. You can view our full `_pkgdown.yml` file on GitHub.

# Push to GitHub & deploy

Once you are happy with your package and your package website, you are ready to push to GitHub. You can use GitHub Pages to deploy your site, but you need to remember that `pkgdown` created your static site in your `docs` folder of your master branch. So in your GitHub repo settings, you'll need to 

![](/post/2018-06-29-data-package_files/pkgdown-gh-pages.png)

I ended up switching to Netlify for deploying the site instead of GitHub Pages, and was able to nab the domain https://bakeoff.netlify.com. The trick with Netlify is to...

look on 538:

https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/tree/master/data-raw

make a script to create `data/` from `data-raw/` automatically:

use R script `process_data_sets.R` in `data-raw/`--> takes csv files as input, do some additional taming, outputs rda files (overwrite = TRUE) using `usethis::use_data()` to output `data/`


2 steps:
- build package (command shift b) (`devtools::build()`)

now: how to actually document a dataset
1) workflow: keep roxygenized script open for each dataset like bakers as `bakers.R` in `R` folder
2) also open a data-process.R in `data-raw/` and edit back and forth as tabs, so `bakers-process.R` this file MUST use `usethis::use_data`, can't just have .rda files in a `data/` folder for it to work.

ok future stuff: enable docsearch (https://daattali.gitbooks.io/stat545-ubc-github-io/bit003_api-key-env-var.html) like nick tierney
- `pkgdown::build_site()`
