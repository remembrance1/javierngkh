We are so tough on ourselves.

For some crazy reason, we think that there’s this fixed set of rules, this dummies’ checklist to life that revolves around our existence, that we are suppose to adhere to. By completing each life’s milestone would mean that we are closer to achieving the “perfect life,” the life that we are supposed to have, to lead.

So we forged ahead, created lofty goals for ourselves and pursued them relentlessly be it in our career, family, education or simply gaining a step up in our social economic status. Its always a rat race, an incessant cycle of being better than who we are yesterday. No doubt, it is beautiful to have goals. 

**But it is also important for us to remember about how far we’ve come and all that we’ve accomplished along the way.**

Sometimes,  we simply forget that we are only human. An imperfect, complex organism that is subjected to inconsistencies, mistakes and failures. You are not made of steel. Even the fiercest storm that can topple the sturdiest of foundations. You will not always be right or make the best decisions in life. You will not always lead by example or shine brightly like a beacon in the skies. You are only human; allowed to feel and take a break.
 
And when you are feeling down and sick of life’s struggles, tell yourself this: You are alive, breathing and have pushed through another day. 

**That by itself, is already a feat.**

Yet many a times we don’t give ourselves credit for that.

We forget about where we are right now, our present moment, the joy we have achieved, our past experiences with wonderful people who have left a notch in our lives and the powerful lessons we have learned along the way. 

Life is a journey of winding turns and twists where behind every corner lies something different. No two experiences are ever the same. It is filled with chaos and change. No matter how big or small every obstacle, roadblock and fear we encountered before in our life, we have gotten through them. 

**You’ve made it to here.** 

And here, is okay too. We are always fixated on what’s next in our life, the goals in front of us. The next level we need to be at. 

But what about this level? The present moment? Where we are today. 

**And that’s an accomplishment.** 

And you must know, that you are worth today.

Take a second to remind yourself just how wonderful you are; be proud of how far you’ve come. Don’t give up and never stop trying. You are doing okay. You’re only human after all.
