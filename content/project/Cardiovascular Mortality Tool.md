**Context:** Improved patient outcome predictions for cardiovascular patients by leveraging machine learning in pharmacogenomics and mortality studies.

**Actions:**

- Led the development and execution of machine learning algorithms for predictive modelling projects.
- Collaborated with Prof. Chester Drum to create and deploy a predictive modelling pipeline using PySpark at the National University Hospital Cardiovascular Unit.
- Processed and integrated data from over 10,000 cardiovascular patients to enhance the accuracy of predictions.

**Outcomes:** Achieved a 30% improvement in patient outcome predictions, significantly enhancing the decision-making capabilities of healthcare providers and contributing to better patient care.
