**Context:** Developed a bin night reminder system using a Raspberry Pi to assist with recycling and waste management based on the Porirua City Council recycling calendar.

**Actions:**

- Utilised Python with Beautiful Soup and Selenium to navigate the Porirua City Council website and extract recycling calendar information.
- Programmed the Raspberry Pi to indicate which bins to put out on the street, using colored LEDs: red for glass, yellow for recycling, and green for general rubbish.

**Outcomes:** Created an effective visual reminder system that helps ensure proper bin management, reducing the likelihood of missed pickups and promoting effective waste disposal practices.
